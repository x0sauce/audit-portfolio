# The `PythOracle.currentValue` function always returns outdated prices

## Description

In `AutomationMaster`, exchange rate is calculated via the `PythOracle.currentValue` function.

However, `PythOracle.currentValue` has incorrect logic where the price retrieved will always be stale due to an incorrect check.

`publishTime` must always be older than the `block.timestamp - noOlderThan`, which means only a price that is stale will prevent the function from reverting.

```solidity
    function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
@>            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan, // @audit wrong check causes price to always be stale
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }
```

## Impact

This check causes two problems:

1. If the price is fresh and up-to-date, the transaction will fail and users won't be able to get exchange rates. This will happen most of the time since prices are regularly updated.
2. If the price hasn't been updated in a while and becomes stale, users will receive outdated prices. Bad actors can take advantage of this by trading at these incorrect prices for their own profit.

## Recommendations

Check that the price is fresher than the a set period before the current block.timestamp.

    `function currentValue() external view override returns (uint256) {
        IPyth.Price memory price = pythOracle.getPriceUnsafe(tokenId);
        require(
-            price.publishTime < block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
+            price.publishTime >= block.timestamp - noOlderThan,
            "Stale Price"
        );
        return uint256(uint64(price.price));
    }`
